Data provided by the claimant when they apply for benefit is analysed by the third party supplier and a risk score returned to the council.This score guides the council in deciding how much evidence to ask the claimant to provide to verify their claim. The aim of RBV is to speed up the processing of low risk claims so the customer can be paid benefit quickly and to identify high risk claims for further investigation tominimise the risk of error or fraud. The decision whether or not to pay benefit to a claimant is not based solely on the RBV score.
